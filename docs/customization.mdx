# Customizing components

---

There are several ways to customize Azrn UI components, from applying custom CSS rules to building fully custom components using hooks.

You have the freedom to decide how much you want to customize a component's structure and style.

## Styling the components

This section reviews several methods of customization that are available: applying custom CSS rules, overriding default subcomponent slots, customizing the slot props, and using hooks to build fully custom components.

### Plain CSS, Sass, Less

...or anything else that compiles to CSS:

You can either [style the components using the built-in classes](#applying-custom-css-rules) or [specify your own classes](#customizing-slot-props) and reference them in your stylesheets.

### CSS Modules

When working with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), the simplest approach is to [specify custom classes using `slotProps`](#customizing-slot-props), as shown below:

```tsx
import clsx from 'clsx';
import classes from './styles.module.css';

export default function Toggle(props) {
    const slotProps = {
        root: (ownerState: ToggleOwnerState) => ({
            className: clsx(classes.root, {
                [classes.checked]: ownerState.checked,
                [classes.disabled]: ownerState.disabled
            })
        }),
        thumb: { className: classes.thumb },
        track: { className: classes.track },
        input: { className: classes.input }
    };

    return <Toggle {...props} slotProps={slotProps} />;
}
```

In this example we're using the [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) utility to reduce the effort needed to apply class names conditionally.

### Tailwind CSS

Use [`slotProps`](#customizing-slot-props) to apply custom styles using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), as shown below:

```tsx
export default function Toggle(props) {
    const slotProps = {
        root: (ownerState: ToggleOwnerState) => ({
            className: `inline-block w-8 h-5 rounded-full cursor-pointer relative ${
                ownerState.checked ? 'bg-cyan-500' : 'bg-zinc-400'
            }`
        }),
        thumb: (ownerState: ToggleOwnerState) => ({
            className: `bg-gray-100 block w-3.5 h-3.5 rounded-full relative top-[3px] ${
                ownerState.checked ? 'left-[3px]' : 'left-[14px]'
            }`
        }),
        input: { className: 'absolute w-full h-full inset-0 opacity-0 z-10 m-0' }
    };

    return <Toggle {...props} slotProps={slotProps} />;
}
```

### Styled components

If you use a CSS-in-JS solution with a styled-components-like API (such [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)), the best method is to provide the styled subcomponents using the [`slots` prop](#overriding-subcomponent-slots).

## Applying custom CSS rules

If you're happy with the default structure of a component's rendered HTML, you can apply custom styles to the component's classes.

Each component has its own set of Tailwind utility classes.
Some classes are **static**, which is to say that they are always present on the component.
Others are applied **conditionally**—like, which is only present when a component is disabled.

Tailwind merge is used to make sure that your own supplied utility classes overwrite any pre-existing ones.

If you don't use the default classes, you can clean up the DOM by disabling them.
See [Disabling default CSS classes](#disabling-default-tailwind-utility-classes) for instructions.

## Overriding subcomponent slots

If you want to make changes to a component's rendered HTML structure, you can override the default subcomponents ("slots") using the `slots` and/or `component` prop—see ["Shared props" on the Usage page](?path=/docs/docs-usage--docs#shared-props) for more details.

The components you pass in the `slots` prop receive the `ownerState` prop from the top-level component (the "owner").
By convention, it contains all props passed to the owner, merged with its rendering state.

For example:

```jsx
<Toggle slots={{ thumb: MyCustomThumb }} data-foo="42" />
```

In this case, `MyCustomThumb` component receives the `ownerState` object with the following data:

```ts
{
  checked: boolean;
  disabled: boolean;
  focusVisible: boolean;
  readOnly: boolean;
  'data-foo': string;
}
```

You can use this object to style your component.

When inserting a component from a third-party library into a slot, you may encounter this warning: `"React does not recognize the ownerState prop on a DOM element."`
This is because the custom component isn't prepared to receive the `ownerState` like a built-in library component would be.

If you need to use the `ownerState` to propagate some props to a third-party component, you must create a custom wrapper for this purpose.
But if you don't need the `ownerState` and just want to resolve the error, you can use the `prepareForSlot` utility:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { prepareForSlot } from '../../utils';
import { Button } from '../Button';

const LinkSlot = prepareForSlot(Link);

export default function PrepareForSlot() {
    return (
        <Button href={'/'} slots={{ root: LinkSlot }}>
            Home
        </Button>
    );
}
```

## Customizing slot props

Use the `slotProps` prop to customize the inner component props.
The most common use case is setting a class name, but you can set any prop, including event handlers.

The following example shows how to add a custom class to two of the Toggle's slots:

```tsx
function Toggle(props: ToggleProps) {
    const slotProps: ToggleProps['slotProps'] = {
        root: {
            className: 'inline-block w-8 h-5 rounded-full cursor-pointer relative'
        },
        thumb: {
            className: 'bg-gray-100 block w-3.5 h-3.5 rounded-full relative top-[3px]'
        },
        input: {
            className: 'p-0 m-0 absolute w-full h-full inset-0 opacity-0 z-10',
            'aria-hidden': true
        }
    };

    return <Toggle {...props} slotProps={slotProps} />;
}
```

The `toggle:thumb` and `toggle:class` are added unconditionally—they will always be present on the Switch component.

You may need to apply a class only when a component is in a particular state.
A good example is adding `on` and `off` classes to a Toggle based on its checked state, as shown in the demo below:

```jsx
export default function SlotPropsCallback() {
    const slotProps = {
        root: (ownerState) => ({
            className: `my-switch ${ownerState.checked ? 'on' : 'off'} ${ownerState.focusVisible ? 'focused' : ''}`
        }),
        thumb: { className: 'thumb' },
        input: { className: 'input' }
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <style type="text/css">{css}</style>

            <Toggle slotProps={slotProps} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

Here, instead of an object with props, the root slot receives a callback function.
Its only parameter is `ownerState`, which is an object that describes the state of the "owner component"—the Toggle in this case.
The `ownerState` holds all the props of the owner component (with defaults applied where applicable) and is augmented with the internal state of the component.
In the case of the Select, the additional information includes the `checked`, `disabled`, `focusVisible`, and `readOnly` boolean fields.

## Creating custom components using hooks

If you need complete control over a component's rendered HTML structure, you can build it with hooks.

Hooks give you access to the _logic_ that a component uses, but without any default structure.
See ["Components vs. hooks" on the Usage page](?path=/docs/docs-usage--docs#components-vs-hooks) for more details.

Hooks return the current state of the component (e.g. `checked`, `disabled`, `open`, etc.) and provide functions that return props you can apply to your fully custom components.

In the case of [Toggle](?path=/docs/inputs-toggle--docs), the component is accompanied by the `useToggle` hook which gives you all the functionality without any structure.

It returns the following object:

```ts
{
    checked: Readonly<boolean>;
    disabled: Readonly<boolean>;
    readOnly: Readonly<boolean>;
    focusVisible: Readonly<boolean>;
    getInputProps: (otherProps?: object) => SwitchInputProps;
}
```

The `checked`, `disabled`, `readOnly`, and `focusVisible` fields represent the state of the toggle.
Use them to apply styling to your HTML elements.

The `getInputProps` function can be used to get the props to place on an HTML `<input>` to make the switch accessible.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import clsx from 'clsx';
import { useToggle, UseToggleParameters } from '../useToggle';

function BasicToggle(props: UseToggleParameters) {
    const { getInputProps, checked, disabled, focusVisible } = useToggle(props);

    const stateClasses = {
        'my-basic-toggle-checked': checked,
        'my-basic-toggle-disabled': disabled,
        'my-basic-toggle-focusVisible': focusVisible
    };

    return (
        <BasicToggleRoot className={clsx(stateClasses)}>
            <BasicToggleThumb className={clsx(stateClasses)} />
            <BasicToggleInput {...getInputProps()} aria-label="Demo toggle" />
        </BasicToggleRoot>
    );
}

export default function StylingHooks() {
    return <BasicToggle />;
}
```

## Disabling default Tailwind utility classes

If you don't need the built-in classes on components, you may disable them.
This will clean up the DOM and can be useful especially if you apply your own classes or style components using a CSS-in-JS solution.
To do this, wrap your components in a `ClassNameConfigurator` component, which is imported from `../../utils`:

```tsx
<ClassNameConfigurator disableDefaultClasses>
    <Button>I'm classless!</Button>
</ClassNameConfigurator>
```
