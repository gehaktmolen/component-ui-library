# Azrn UI

---

Azrn UI is a library of headless ("un-styled") React UI components and low-level hooks.

## Introduction

The library includes prebuilt components with production-ready functionality, along with low-level hooks for transferring that functionality to other components.

The default styling and behaviour of the components are opinionated and based on the Azerion brand. This keeps our products consistent. However, it is still possible to override/ disable default styles and use your own engine or theme if you choose so, for each integrated component.

## @mui

The UI component library is based on [Mui Base UI](https://mui.com/base-ui/getting-started/) (currently in Beta), a popular headless React UI framework. We took the liberty to use its structural ideology and make it work for our needs.
