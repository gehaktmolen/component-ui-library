# Popper

---

The Popper component lets you create tooltips and popovers that display information about an element on the page.

## Introduction

The Popper is a utility component for creating various kinds of popups. It relies on the third-party library ([Popper.js v2](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/)) for positioning.

## Component

### Usage

```jsx
import { Popper } from '../Popper';

export default function MyApp() {
    return <Popper>{/* the popper's content */}</Popper>;
}
```

### Basics

By default, the Popper is mounted to the DOM when its `open` prop is set to `true`, and removed from the DOM when `open` is `false`.

`anchorEl` is passed as the reference object to create a new `Popper.js` instance. The children are placed in a [Portal](?path=/docs/utils-portal--docs) prepended to the body of the document to avoid rendering problems. You can disable this behavior with `disablePortal` prop.

The following demo shows how to create and style a basic popper. Click Toggle Popper to see how it behaves:

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={PopperDefaultStories.PlacementPopper} />

By default, clicking outside the popper does not hide it. If you need this behavior, you can use the [Click-Away Listener](?path=/docs/utils-clickawaylistener--docs) component.

### Customization

## Placement

The popper's default placement is `bottom`. You can change it using the `placement` prop. Try changing this value to `top` in the interactive demo below to see how it works:

## Transitions

You can animate the open and close states of the popper with a render prop child and a transition component, as long as the component meets these conditions:

-   Is a direct child descendant of the popper
-   Calls the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts
-   Calls the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed

These two callbacks allow the popper to unmount the child content when closed and fully transitioned.

## API

### Import

```jsx
import { Popper } from '../Popper';
```

### Parameters

<ArgTypes of={Popper} />
