# FocusTrap

---

The Focus Trap component prevents the user's focus from escaping its children components.

## Introduction

Focus Trap is a utility component that's useful when implementing an overlay such as a [modal](?path=/docs/utils-modal--docs) dialog, which should block all interactions outside of it while open.

## Component

### Usage

```jsx
import { FocusTrap } from '../Modal';

export default function MyApp() {
    return <FocusTrap>{/* children where the focus will be trapped */}</FocusTrap>;
}
```

### Basics

Focus Trap wraps around the UI elements that should hold the user's focus. For instance, if the focus needs to stay inside a [Menu](?path=/docs/navigation-menu--docs), then the component will be structured like this:

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={FocusTrapDefaultStories.Primary} />
