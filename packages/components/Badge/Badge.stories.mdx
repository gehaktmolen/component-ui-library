# Badge

---

The Badge component generates a small label that is attached to its child element.

## Introduction

A badge is a small descriptor for UI elements. It typically sits on or near an element and indicates the status of that element by displaying a number, icon, or other short set of characters.

The Badge component creates a badge that is applied to its child element.

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={BadgeDefaultStories.Rectangular} />

## Component

### Usage

After installation, you can start building with this component using the following basic elements:

```jsx
import { Badge } from './Badge';

export default function MyApp() {
    return <Badge>{/* the element that the badge is attached to */}</Badge>;
}
```

### Basics

The Badge wraps around the UI element that it's attached to. For instance, if the badge indicates the number of emails in an inbox, then the component will be structured like this:

```js
<Badge>
    <Icon icon="heart" size="2xl" color="primary" />
</Badge>
```

### Anatomy

The Badge component is composed of a root `<span>` that houses the element that the badge is attached to, followed by a `<span>` slot to represent the badge itself:

```html
<span class="root">
    <!-- the element the badge is attached to is nested here -->
    <span class="badge">badge content</span>
</span>
```

### Custom structure

Use the slots prop to override the root or any other interior slot:

```js
<Badge slots={{ root: 'div', badge: 'div' }} />
```

The slots prop is available on all non-utility components. See Overriding component structure for full details.

Use the `slotProps` prop to pass custom props to internal slots. The following code snippet applies a CSS class called `my-badge` to the badge slot:

```js
<Badge slotProps={{ badge: { className: 'my-badge' } }} />
```

### Usage with TypeScript

In TypeScript, you can specify the custom component type used in the `slots.root` as a generic parameter of the unstyled component. This way, you can safely provide the custom root's props directly on the component:

```typescript jsx
<Badge<typeof CustomComponent> slots={{ root: CustomComponent }} customProp />
```

The same applies for props specific to custom primitive elements:

```typescript jsx
<Badge<'img'> slots={{ root: 'img' }} src="badge.png" />
```

## Hooks

```js
import { useBadge } from '../useBadge';
```

The `useBadge` hook lets you apply the functionality of a select to a fully custom component. It returns props to be placed on the custom component, along with fields representing the component's internal state.

Hooks do not support [slot props](?path=/docs/docs-intro--docs#the-slotprops-prop), but they do support [customization](?path=docs-customization--docs) props.

Hooks give you the most room for customization, but require more work to implement. With hooks, you can take full control over how your component is rendered, and define all the custom props and CSS/ Tailwind classes you need.

## Customization

The following features can be used with both components and hooks. For the sake of simplicity, demos and code snippets primarily feature components.

### Badge content

The `badgeContent` prop defines the content that's displayed inside the badge. When this content is a number, there are additional props you can use for further customization—see the [Numerical badges](#numerical-badges) section below.

The following demo shows how to create and style a typical numerical badge that's attached to a generic box element:

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={BadgeDefaultStories.BadgeContent} />

### Badge visibility

You can control the visibility of a badge by using the invisible prop. Setting a badge to `invisible` does not actually hide it—instead, this prop adds the appropriate Tailwind classes to the badge, but you can overwrite these as you please.

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={BadgeDefaultStories.BadgeVisibility} />

### Numerical badges

The following props are useful when `badgeContent` is a number.

#### The showZero prop

By default, badges automatically hide when `badgeContent={0}`. You can override this behavior with the `showZero` prop.

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={BadgeDefaultStories.ShowZero} />

#### The max prop

You can use the `max` prop to set a maximum value for `badgeContent`. The default is 99.

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={BadgeDefaultStories.Max} />

## API

### Import

```jsx
import { Badge } from '../Badge';
```

### Parameters

<ArgTypes of={Badge} />

The `ref` is forwarded to the root element.

### Slots

To learn how to customize the slot, check out the [Overriding component structure](?path=/docs/docs-intro--docs#overriding-component-structure) guide.

| Name    | Element  | Description                           |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `root`  | `<span>` | The component that renders the root.  |
| `badge` | `<span>` | The component that renders the badge. |
