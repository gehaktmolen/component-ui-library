# Modal

---

The Modal component lets you create dialogs, popovers, lightboxes, and other elements that force the user to take action before continuing.

## Introduction

Modal is a utility component that renders its children in front of a backdrop. This lets you create an element that your users must interact with before continuing in the parent application.

### Features

-   Manages modal stacking when more than one is needed
-   Creates a backdrop to disable interaction with the rest of the app
-   Disables page scrolling while open
-   Manages focus correctly between the modal and its parent app
-   Adds the appropriate ARIA roles automatically

The term "modal" is sometimes used interchangeably with "dialog," but this is incorrect. A dialog may be modal or non-modal (modeless).

A modal [blocks interaction with the rest of the application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window), forcing the user to take action. As such, it should be used sparinglyâ€”only when the app requires user input before it can continue.

## Component

### Usage

```jsx
import { Modal } from '../Modal';

export default function MyApp() {
    return <Modal>{/* the modal's content */}</Modal>;
}
```
