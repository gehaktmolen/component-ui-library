# Modal

---

The Modal component lets you create dialogs, popovers, lightboxes, and other elements that force the user to take action before continuing.

## Introduction

Modal is a utility component that renders its children in front of a backdrop. This lets you create an element that your users must interact with before continuing in the parent application.

### Features

-   Manages modal stacking when more than one is needed
-   Creates a backdrop to disable interaction with the rest of the app
-   Disables page scrolling while open
-   Manages focus correctly between the modal and its parent app
-   Adds the appropriate ARIA roles automatically

The term "modal" is sometimes used interchangeably with "dialog," but this is incorrect. A dialog may be modal or non-modal (modeless).

A modal [blocks interaction with the rest of the application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window), forcing the user to take action. As such, it should be used sparingly—only when the app requires user input before it can continue.

Modal is a lower-level construct that is used in the following Material UI components:

-   [Dialog](?path=/docs/feedback-dialog--docs)
-   [Menu](?path=/docs/navigation-menu--docs)
-   [Drawer](?path=/docs/surfaces-drawer--docs)

## Component

### Usage

```jsx
import { Modal } from '../Modal';

export default function MyApp() {
    return <Modal>{/* the modal's content */}</Modal>;
}
```

### Basics

The following demo shows how to create and style a basic modal. Click Open modal to see how it behaves:

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={ModalDefaultStories.Basics} />

## Customization

### Nested modal

Though it is possible to create nested Modals—for example, a select modal within a dialog—stacking more than two at a time is discouraged.

This is because each successive Modal blocks interaction with all elements behind it, making prior states inaccessible and overly complicated for the user to navigate through.

The following demo shows how to nest one Modal within another:

<Canvas sourceState="hidden" of={ModalDefaultStories.Nested} />

## API

### Import

```jsx
import { Modal } from '../Modal';
```

### Parameters

Props of the native component are also available.

<ArgTypes of={Modal} />

### Slots

To learn how to customize the slot, check out the [Overriding component structure](?path=/docs/docs-intro--docs#overriding-component-structure) guide.

| Name       | Element | Description                              |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `root`     | `<div>` | The component that renders the root.     |
| `backdrop` |         | The component that renders the backdrop. |
